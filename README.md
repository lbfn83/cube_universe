# **Feature**
* Camera move ( Yaw and Pitch )
* Collision detection and resolution
* Randomized movement of cubes

# **Controls ( key binds )**
1. Camera movement
   * Forward : w
   * Back : s
   * Left : a
   * Right : d
   * Rotation: Drag the mouse around while holding down the right mouse button

2. Moving cube object Rotation

    * X axis rotation : up and down arrow
    * Y axis rotation : left and right arrow
# **Future**
1. Add Cube's z rotation
2. Any keyboard input related to the rotation of Cube should pause the movement of cube for a certain amount of time and then resume randomized movement after timer expires
